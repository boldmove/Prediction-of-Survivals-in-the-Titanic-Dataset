# 🚢 Prediction of Survivors in the Titanic Dataset

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting passenger survival from the infamous Titanic disaster using data science and machine learning techniques. The analysis is performed using the Titanic dataset, which provides detailed information about passengers, such as their age, sex, class, and other attributes.

## 📄 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Explore the Titanic dataset to identify key factors influencing passenger survival.
- Build predictive models to estimate survival probabilities.
- Interpret the results to gain insights into survival patterns.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.

## 📊 Data Description

The Titanic dataset includes the following key features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive).
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Fare**: Ticket fare.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

The project uses several machine learning models for prediction:
1. **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification.
2. **Decision Trees**: For interpretable decision-making.
3. **Random Forests**: For ensemble-based prediction.
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: For robust classification.

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

## 📈 Key Insights

- Gender and passenger class significantly influenced survival chances.
- Younger passengers had a higher probability of survival.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to those in second and third class.
